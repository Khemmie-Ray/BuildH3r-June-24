# ZKSync-(Matter-labs)

## A brief exploration of Account Abstraction

- Overview: Picture a scenario where joining the Web3 world doesnâ€™t mean you have to worry about protecting a 12-word seed phrase or your private key, or requires getting into the nitty-gritty of the technicalities of the ecosystem. Account abstraction has made this possible, creating a world where wallets are programmable for a smoother user experience and enhanced security. Account abstraction shifts from the rigid authorization methods of (EOAs) to customizable smart contracts.
